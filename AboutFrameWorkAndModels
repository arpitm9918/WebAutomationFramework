Ques. What Is Page Object Model and what are its advantage?
Ans. Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object
repository for storing all web elements.
It helps reduce code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file(It means divide your pages).
Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements(Page Locators and Page Actions).
Using these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.
Advantage Of POM:-
    1. Easy Maintenance
    2. Code Resusibility
    3. Readability and Reliability of Scripts
